# Personality Predictor

This Python project trains three models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Linear SVM) to predict the Myer-Briggs personality type associated with input text. The models are trained using a publicly available [personality prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). Finally, a simple server is started up and an endpoint is created which allows the user to input the text to be classified and the classifier which will run the prediction.
