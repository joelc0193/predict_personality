# Personality Predictor

This Python project uses the publicly available [personality prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) to train three models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Linear SVM) to predict the Myer-Briggs personality type associated with input text. Once trained, a simple server is started up and an endpoint is created which allows the user to input the custom text to be classified and the classifier to run the prediction.
